# Integration Project

This project was built as part of my journey to learn how to integrate a React frontend with a backend API using Express.js. I focused on implementing full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, while using modern tools like Formik, Yup, and Material-UI for form handling and UI.

## Features

- React frontend using:
  - Formik for form handling
  - Yup for form validation
  - Material-UI for UI components
  - Material-UI DataGrid to display student data

-Backend
 -Get request
 -Post request
 -Put request
 -Delete request

## How to Use

- View student data in a table powered by DataGrid.
- Add new students via a form with validation.
- The frontend communicates with the backend to fetch and post data.
 
-Update student via table

-Delete student via table

## Technologies Used

- Formik
